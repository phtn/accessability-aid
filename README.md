NDIS

Navigating the NDIS: Your Guide to Getting the Right Support and Independence
At AccessAbility Aid, we know that figuring out disability support can be tough. That's where the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) steps in – it's there to help individuals with disabilities like you get the support you need to lead an empowered life.

What is the NDIS?
The NDIS is like a helpful friend for people with disabilities in Australia. It's all about giving you choices, control, and making sure you get the help that fits your needs. Whether it's help with daily tasks, therapy, or joining your community, the NDIS is here to support you.

How Does It Work?

1. Check Your Eligibility: First things first, to use the NDIS, you need to check if you're eligible. It's based on things like your disability, age, and where you live. Don't worry, we'll guide you through this part.
2. Plan Your Goals: Once you're in, it's time to plan. You'll work with us to make a plan that's all about what you want to achieve and what help you need to get there.
3. Choose Your Support: The NDIS lets you pick who helps you. You get to decide what works best for you. We're here to help, and we're ready to provide the services you want.
